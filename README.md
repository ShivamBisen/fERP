fERP - Feedback ERP
====================
Automate the process of filling up the feedback form in ERP.

**Disclaimer**: The developer does not hold any responsibility for the use / abuse of these scripts. **Use them at your own discretion**.

#### How to use these scripts?
1. Open the feedback form (Academic > Feedback form) of ERP.
2. Click on the subject code and the professor button.
3. Open console in browser.
   To do that, press ``F12`` for firefox & ``Ctrl + Shift + J`` in Chrome.
4. Copy the code from your desired variant of `*_feedback.js` and paste in that console window and hit Enter.
5. All fields would be filled by now (If not refresh 2-3 times and try again).
6. Fill up the captcha and submit.
    
> [**FIX**] Firefox shows scam warning on copy pasting commands into the console!

To avoid that, simply enter the command `allow pasting` in the console.<br>
After running that command, copy pasting will start to work.
