fERP - Feedback ERP
====================
Automate the process of filling up the feedback form in ERP.

    1. Open the feedback form of ERP.
    2. Click on the subject code and the professor button.
    3. Open console in browser.
       To do that, press ``F12`` for firefox, press ``Ctrl + Shift + J`` in Chrome.
    4. Copy the code in feedback.js and paste in that console window and hit Enter.
    5. All fields would be filled by now (If not refresh 2-3 times and try again).
    6. Fill up the captcha and submit.
    
Enjoy!!!<br>

[**UPDATE**] Firefox now shows scam warning on copy pasting commands in the developer console.
To avoid that, simply enter the command `allow pasting` in the console.
After running that command, copy pasting will start to work.

[**UPDATE**] `variant/Positive-Feedback.js` is added, which replaces the word `NIL` with positive feedback for the instructor and the course randomly selected from a list of comments.
Follow the same steps to use the script.
